# EDA to MLOps with ZenML & MLflow ðŸš€

This project showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built using **ZenML**, **MLflow**, and **pandas**. It starts from **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and progresses to a **production-grade MLOps workflow**, demonstrating key components like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and experiment tracking.
